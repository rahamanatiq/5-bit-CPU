# 5-bit-CPU

I designed a 5-bit CPU featuring a 4-bit Program Counter (PC) Adder, a 4-bit Program Counter, a 5-bit Register Set, and a 5-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The CPU is equipped with a 10x17 RAM for data storage. This project was developed using Digital, a simulator for digital circuits, which helped in testing and verifying the CPU's functionality. The CPU design project showcases proficiency in digital logic design and hardware simulation, providing a hands-on experience in building and testing a complete processor. It also emphasizes the practical application of theoretical concepts in creating efficient computing systems.
